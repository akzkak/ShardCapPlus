# ShardCap for WoW version 1.12
Automatically delete soul shards above a certain amount (default 28).

Deletes soulshards when you exit combat.

TODO: If you or your pet is dead, don't delete any shards.


Change cap to 5: /shardcap 5


Change cap to 128: /shardcap 128





Deletes from your backpack first, then 2nd bag, then 3rd bag, and so on. This way you always have your shards in your last bag (where most people put their soul bag).
