# ShardCap for WoW version 1.12

Super simple and invisible addon.

Automatically delete soul shards above a certain amount (default 12). At levels 10-20 I normally set it 5 because bags are small and soulbags come later. 

Deletes soulshards excess when you exit combat.

This addon deletes backwards, so that your shards always fill your soulbag first.
