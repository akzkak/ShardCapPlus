# ShardCap for WoW version 1.12
Automatically delete soul shards above a certain amount (default 28).

Change cap to 5: /shardcap 5
Change cap to 128: /shardcap 128

Deletes excess soulshards when you exit combat.

Deletes from your backpack first, then 2nd bag, then 3rd bag, and so on. This way you always have your shards in your last bag (where most people put their soul bag).
