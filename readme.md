# ShardCap for WoW version 1.12
Automatically delete soul shards above a certain amount (default 12). At levels 10-20 I normally set it 5 because bags are small and soulbags come later. 

Deletes soulshards when you exit combat.

Change cap to 5: /shardcap 5


Change cap to 128: /shardcap 128


This addon deletes backwards, so that your shards always fill your soulbag first.
